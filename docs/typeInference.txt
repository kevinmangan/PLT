******* UNIFICATION *******
***************************

Basic idea:
- the process of finding a substitution that makes two given terms equal
- type inference done by applying unification to type expressions (e.g. 'a -> 'b -> 'a).
- essential task is to find a substitution S that unifies two given terms
- write s S for the result of applying the substitution S to the term s
- given s and t, we want to find the unifier S such that s S = t S
