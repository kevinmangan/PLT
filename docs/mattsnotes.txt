maybe it's "GET, POST, PUT etc "

collect



//SYNC CASE
scrape "www.google.com" to goog //blocking

//we have access go goog here
for links in goog.links:
	print link.text


//ASYNC CASE
scrape async "www.google.com" to googProxy //non blocking

for values in googProxy.links //this fails because googProxy is just a reference to the async task

collect googProxy to goog

//now goog is same as above

for links in goog.links:
	print link.text



//post example

scrape "www.imdb.com" to mysite posting search as "hey", query as "what what"



1) GET "www.google.com" -> goog //goog represents reference to the task


//enter code hdere
2) 

3) Collect goog -> mypage

//do stuff on mypage


POST "www.imbd.com" using {search: hey} -> imdb

PUT mylistofurls using mylistofobjects -> listofpages



mylist = ["www.google.com/a", "www.google.com/b"];


GET "www.google.com" -> goog


foreach link goog


GET "www.amazon.com" -> am

foreach link in am
