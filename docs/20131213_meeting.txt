TDOO FOR FINAL REPORT
- Alden finish type inference description
- Dean read it over

TODO FOR SLIDES
  1) an overview of the language and its motivation,
  2) a tutorial introduction to the language including an example or two,
  3) a discussion of how the language was implemented, and
  4) a summary including lessons learned.

TODO FOR PRESENTATION
- Alden create two use cases
- Kevin create two use cases USING DISTRIBUTE




DONE THINGS
- readFile() return list of lines, but read() return one line
- Kevin download(), readFile(), read(), printFile() test
- Kevin write Lessons Learned
- Sireesh write Lessons Learned
- Sireesh distribute() tests
- Alden scanner special characters => \', "'", etc.


TODO DISTRIBUTE
- if i have 12 slaves and i distribute a function to teach of them, will it work?
- if i have 12 slaves and distribute 4 items, then distribute 7 items, what happens? start from slave 1 again?
- if i have 12 slaves and distribute 30 items, what happens?

this correctly gets through the scanner, but breaks in java:
print("\"");

generated java: Writer.print(new PCList("""));

this does not get past our scanner, but it should:
print("'");

DO WE WANT TO ADD THE x -> { x + 1 } syntax?
IT WOULD BE SUGAR FOR x -> { return x + 1; }

INTRO TO LANGUAGE SECTION SHOULD SHOULD FIB, shows recursion and basic language

can't pass our std library functions around because they are not PCFunctions, they are static...
this breaks in javagen and in java code :(

JAVAGEN BREAKS OUR PARSER.
This should work, but it fails:
firstLine = List.split(webPageString, '\n')[0];
