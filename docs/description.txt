pubCrawl is a distributed systems programming language with a focus on 
list operations. Given some number of networked slave computers, it will
automatically split work up among them, requiring the developer only to specify
whether a function should distribute work or not. In implementing it, we
will also attempt to implement redundant processing, so that processed data is 
not lost in the case of an unstable network.

To accomplish this, the developer will specify the IP addresses of the slave 
computers, which will be running a slave server utility. At compile time, the 
compiler sends to each of these machines a list of all the functions that can 
be called as a part of this program. It then passes the data to each slave 
computer as the functions are called, and refers to the functions by a unique 
hash name that is assigned at compilation time. This is done with blocking- the
program does not continue until all the results have been received.
