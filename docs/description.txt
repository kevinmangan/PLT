pubCrawl is a distributed systems programming language with a focus on 
list operations. Given some number of networked slave computers, it will
automatically split work up among them, requiring the developer only to specify
whether a function should distribute work or not. To create a robust platform, we
will also implement redundant processing, so that processed data is 
not lost in the case of an unstable network.

To distribute work, the developer will specify the IP addresses of the slave 
computers, which will be running a slave server utility. When the output program is run, 
it sends compiled and serialized functions to the remote servers. It then passes data to each slave 
computer as the functions are called. This is blocking - the
program does not continue until all the results have been received.
